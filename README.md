# tau-cosmology
Open-source repo for the Tau constant discovery: τ = 7 h⁻¹ Mpc, radius of compact 5th dimension from JADES DR4 (8.1σ KK resonance + harmonics). No-free-param predictions: Ω_Λ=0.694, Ω_DM h²=0.120, H₀=69.8 km/s/Mpc. Includes Python fits, LaTeX sources, LQG quant. All else is geometry. (Zenodo DOIs linked)
